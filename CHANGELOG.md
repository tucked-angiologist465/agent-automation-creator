## AAC Framework

### [1.1] — 2026-05-14

Pressure-tested release. Forked from v1.0 after applying the framework to the Rx fax → RevolutionEHR Augment workflow.

**Added**
- Confidence thresholds default by action consequence (Reversible-cheap = 0.6, Reversible-costly = 0.8, Irreversible-bounded = 0.92, Irreversible-unbounded = C not eligible)
- Cross-check conditionality defaults by action consequence (unconditional for Irreversible-bounded)
- Graduation criteria scale with per-error cost band (5 bands from <$10 to >$1M)
- Hard-refuse policy classes as a new Bounded sub-section
- Four data-handling constraint dimensions: Data Classification, Provider Contract, Data Residency, Retention + Deletion
- Terminal H vs migration-eligible H distinction with 5 reason classes (Regulatory, Contractual, Risk Policy, Capability Gap, Cultural/Brand)
- Value mode (Replace / Augment / Extend) required field in Spec Section 2
- Rubric expanded from 51 to 57 items

**Locked**
- 12 canonical work element types
- 4 runtimes (D / C / A / H)
- 5 closed-loop AI disciplines
- 16 spec sections
- Cross-domain constraint dimension mapping (Appendix B)

### [1.0] — 2026-04 (internal)
